		About Us

We are a duo of programmers from De Anza College. 
Over a few months, we learned web development using ChatGPT, 
w3schools, and online resources, and created this demo website using 
React JS, Next JS, MySQL and more to showcase our skills. Despite 
challenges, our teamwork and mutual support made it possible.


Hi! I'm Franklin, a first year De Anza student(expected graduation 2025). I designed the frontend, routing functionalities
and ____ of the website. In my free time I like to work out, play instruments, design projects and I'm also a huge boxing nerd as well!
